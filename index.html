This one-day <a href="http://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data/training/carpentry/">Carpentry@UiO</a> hands-on workshop will introduce you to Python for analyzing and visualizing <b>spatio-temporal data</b>. We will be using datasets from the environmental sciences that are freely available.

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
    The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
    <br>
    <i>Prerequisites:</i>
      <strong>
      <ol>
<li>  Learners need to understand what files and directories are and
     what a working directory is. These concepts are covered in the 
     <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">Unix Shell</a>
     lesson.</li>
<li> Learners need to have some prior knowledge of Python. For instance,
     what is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson 
     <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">Programming with Python</a> is sufficient.</li>
<li>Learners must install Python. See the setup instructions <a href=#setup>below</a>.</li>
<li>A few additional python libraries need to be installed before the class starts. See <a href=https://annefou.github.io/metos_python/setup/>here</a> which packages and how to install them. </li>
<li>Learners must get the metos data before class starts: please download and unzip the file <a href=https://zenodo.org/record/995709/files/metos-python-data.tar>metos-python-data.tar</a>.</li>

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<!--
  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  you will need access to install software on your laptop as described <a href=https://annefou.github.io/metos_python/setup/>here</a>.
  In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "{{site.swc_github}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
  However, if you have any problems, do not hesitate to contact us and to come earlier on the day. We will help you to finalize your set-up between 8:30 and 9:00.

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
